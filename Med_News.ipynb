In an interview with TOI, she spoke about the indigenous solution to unique health challenges of high altitude, specific focused programmes for Indian Air Force fighter pilots and submariners of the Indian Navy, and key projects that they plan to complete in the near future.\\nWhat is your roadmap for improving combat medical services for the forces?\\nWe already achieved desirable efficiency, coordination, and interoperability among the tri-service elements of the AFMS in delivering seamless combat medical services.\\nChampions Trophy 2025\\nIND vs PAK Live: India target semis spot, Pakistan desperate for survival\\n'Wrong anthem, 'missing' Indian flag ...': CT marred by off-field blunders\\nHow to Watch IND vs PAK Champions Trophy Match in US, India and Dubai\\nTraining and augmentation of infrastructure and resources for the same at various echelons is an ongoing process. Impetus is being given to various research projects to enhance patient care and safety in combat medical support.\\nWhich key infrastructure projects will you initiate or complete in the coming years?\\nThe AFMS recently released a vision document aligned with 'Viksit Bharat @ 2047'. We aim to modernise and expand the infrastructure of military hospitals and field medical units. Various upcoming projects include upgrading field hospitals with modular facilities for enhanced mobility. The 'Yodha Rakshak' programme is a grassroots reform aimed at training all combatants in life-saving skills to empower them to perform self and buddy care during conflict. An Institute of Military Medicine at Lucknow as a Centre of Excellence for combat medical care is on the anvil. A study of patterns of injuries in various conflicts around the world is being envisaged. It will help us prepare for providing medical care in the future. Moreover, developing indigenous solutions to the unique health challenges of high altitude and establishing the High-Altitude Medical Research Institute at Leh would be our priority area.\\nOn health concerns faced by the IAF's fighter pilots and naval personnel serving in submarines\\nWe implemented targeted programmes for these specialised groups. Fighter pilots undergo regular health screenings, with a specific focus on spatial disorientation, G-force tolerance, and stress management. For submariners, we focus on decompression sickness, psychological well-being, and auditory health along with many other aspects, given the unique challenges of prolonged underwater deployment.\\nConsidering the vast deployment of the Indian Army troops across the country, what challenges does AFMS face in providing quality healthcare to them?\\nWe successfully overcame logistical and environmental challenges time and again. Our operational readiness and capabilities to deploy healthcare resources at short notice have been practically demonstrated nationally and internationally. Be it the operationalisation of COVID-19 hospitals in 2020 at various cities in the country or providing relief during the Turkey Earthquake in 2023 or routine healthcare delivery and casualty evacuation from forward field areas such as Siachen Glacier are among crucial successful efforts in the recent past. We are constantly evolving and collaborating to keep pace with technological advancements in healthcare delivery in sync with organisational requirements.\\nWhat are plans to tackle the shortage of doctors in the armed forces?\\nThe requirement of manpower is assessed periodically, and the organisation’s mandate is to induct the best human resources to serve our clientele and fulfil various operational needs. AFMC, one of the premier medical colleges in the country, trains medical graduates for serving the armed forces. In addition, we regularly conduct interviews of medical graduates and specialists from other medical colleges for selection in the AFMS. Regular efforts are underway to attract the best talent in the services. Outreach programmes are being organised at various medical institutions to sensitise medical students about the career opportunities being offered by the AFMS. AFMC has an intake of 150 students for MBBS. As of now, there is no plan to increase it. We recruit around 250-450 Medical Officers (MOs) every year and have taken adequate steps to cover the shortage.\\nHow do you see AFMC's role in the near future?\\nAFMC will continue to be the cornerstone of AFMS by producing world-class medical professionals. We envision it evolving into a global centre for medical research and innovation, emphasising collaborations with international institutions and fostering an environment of academic excellence.\\nWhat new research areas have been identified?\\nMy predecessors already facilitated MoUs with premier institutes such as ICMR, IITs, AIIMS, New Delhi, and other institutes. We encourage collaborative projects and short-term and long-term training, including PhDs by our officers from premier training institutes. Innovations through iDEX and TDAC, collaboration with DRDO in Marine Medicine, upgradation of the Institute of Naval Medicine at INHS Asvini for underwater medicine, and the 'Samudrayaan' project with the National Institute of Ocean Technology are some other areas we are working on. Healthcare research is being undertaken by experts at the Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Bangalore, and the Institute of Naval Medicine, INHS Asvini, Mumbai, as well as providing diagnostic and curative services of the highest standards to dependent clientele.\\nBeing the first woman as the head of the AFMS, tell us about your illustrious journey.\\nIt was an inspiring journey to become the first woman to lead the organisation (AFMS). It was a privilege to serve in all three services. From being the only lady in the armed forces in Kashmir Valley when I served at Kupwara (1998-1999), to medical units at Port Blair and Kochi, at Naval Science and Technological Laboratory, Vizag, and at the Centres of Excellence such as Army Hospital Research & Referral, New Delhi, and Command Hospital at Pune, the experiences garnered deepened my commitment to our soldiers and their well-being. It was challenging to serve as the Command Medical Officer of the Southern and Western Naval Command during COVID-19. I was fortunate to command AFMC, my alma mater, and then served as Director General of Medical Services of the Navy and Air Force. In 39 years of service, I faced many challenges and always remained motivated to serve to the best of my abilities. I undertook a revision of standards of patient safety and quality in AFMS and continued fostering preventive and promotive health, which the armed forces stand for.\\nStay updated with breaking \\nnews\\n, \\nbank holidays\\n and upcoming\\n public holidays in march\\n.\",\n",

However, the Maintenance of Standards of Medical Education Regulations 2023 gazetted in Sept 2023, give the NMC vast powers to penalise medical colleges monetarily, or by withholding accreditation, or by reducing seats.\\nIn Jan 2024, in response to an RTI application NMC refused to share details of what action was taken against the offending colleges claiming that the matter was sub judice. However, in response to yet another RTI application on the same issue, on Tuesday it stated that \"NMC is the regulatory body which issues guidelines, regulations from time to time. The implementation of the guidelines /instruction/advisory is solely at the discretion of the concerned state authorities under which the medical college/institute is located\".\\nOn Aug 11, 2023, the NMC issued an advisory on payment of stipend to PG medical students directing all private colleges to pay stipend in keeping with the \\nPost Graduate Medical Education Regulation\\n 2000. \"All the self-financed/private medical colleges are warned that NMC will take strict action for non-compliance of the provisions of the Regulations of PGMER, 2000, if any complaint is received in the future,\" stated the advisory. Supreme Court has ruled in 2022 and 2023 in favour of students stating that stipend has to be paid by govt and private medical colleges.\\nOn Nov 28, 2024, NMC issued a show cause notice to 198 colleges (115 govt and 83 private ones) for not submitting details of stipend paid to undergraduate interns, postgraduate residents, senior residents and postgraduates in super specialty courses, as directed through a public notice issued in April 2024. This notice was issued on the direction of SC. The court asked NMC to submit the details of stipend paid to interns and residents in all colleges. The NMC threatened penal action against colleges for their failure to submit the required information.\\n\"The NMC is being evasive regarding the action taken against the medical colleges stating it is the discretion of state authorities It is clear that the NMC is solely responsible for non-compliance of regulations by private medical colleges regarding payment of stipend,\" said Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and RTI activist who filed the request seeking details of the action taken against the colleges.\\nThe Aug 2023 advisory was issued by NMC following an online survey among undergraduate and post graduate students in private medical colleges which revealed that hundreds of colleges were not paying stipend equal to that being paid in govt colleges as stipulated. Thousands of students also stated that they were not receiving any stipend. Shockingly, 1,228 students informed NMC that the stipend given was taken back by the college management.\\nStay informed with the latest \\nIndia\\n news, updates on \\npublic holidays\\n, and \\nbank holidays in March\\n.',\n",

Instead of the prescribed UTI medication, he mistakenly gave the dog Ambien, a sedative commonly used to treat insomnia in humans.\\nBeckey had asked her boyfriend to give their two dogs their medications while she was out. However, when she returned, he casually mentioned that he had given both dogs their pills—immediately setting off alarm bells in Beckey’s mind. As per the People, she said, \"I had asked my boyfriend to give our dog his medication while I was out, but when I came home, he told me he had medicated both dogs.”\\n“I knew that was impossible because we were out of Nellie\\'s UTI medication,” she recalled, realizing in horror that Nellie had ingested her Ambien instead. The confusion was understandable. Beckey had multiple pill bottles from different veterinary clinics—some were brown, while others were blue. Unfortunately, her Ambien prescription also came in a brown bottle, leading her boyfriend to assume it was Nellie’s medication. \\n\"He thought he was giving her the right pill because it was next to our other dog’s medication,\" she explained. Realizing the mistake, Beckey immediately called her veterinarian, who instructed her to contact the Pet Poison Helpline. She then rushed Nellie to an urgent care veterinary clinic in Omaha, Nebraska.\\nAt the clinic, the vets worked closely with poison specialists, as many veterinarians aren’t trained specifically in toxicology. Nellie was given treatment to induce vomiting, administered activated charcoal to absorb the toxins, and placed on IV fluids for overnight monitoring. \\n\"Nellie’s doing great now, but it was a scary and expensive process,\" Beckey shared, revealing that the treatment cost around $1,200, even with pet insurance. Luckily, Nellie fully recovered, but the incident serves as a powerful reminder for all pet owners. A small mistake can lead to a life-threatening situation, making proper medication storage and handling essential to \\nkeeping pets safe\\n.\\nTo prevent accidents like Nellie\\'s, Dr. Renee Schmid, a senior veterinary toxicologist, emphasizes the importance of keeping pet medications separate from human medications. She also advises pet owners with multiple animals to store each pet\\'s medication separately, as mixing up bottles can be easy and potentially dangerous, leading to serious health consequences if the wrong medication is given.',\n",

              "  'article_text': '1\\n2\\n \\nDibrugarh: In the heart of Dibrugarh town, a red-brick colonial structure that once pioneered medical education in the northeast is a silent testimony to unexplained delays and unfulfilled promises.\\nThe \\nDr John Berry White Medical School\\n, which was slated for transformation into a museum seven years ago, remains abandoned and incomplete, drawing fierce criticism from locals.\\nThe ambitious restoration project, funded by \\nOil India Limited\\n (OIL) with a budget of Rs 2.1 crore under its corporate social responsibility initiative, began with great promise in Jan 2018. OIL signed a memorandum of understanding with the \\nIndian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage\\n (INTACH) to preserve, restore and convert the historic structure into a museum. However, the project, which was originally scheduled for completion in April 2019, remains unfinished in Feb 2025.\\nDibrugarh residents expressed their disappointment over the prolonged delay in completing the project.\\n\"It\\'s heartbreaking to see such a historically significant structure in such a state of neglect. The authorities have failed to honour Dr White\\'s legacy. We were promised a museum that would celebrate our heritage, but seven years later, we are still waiting,\" said Rupam Baruah, a local.\\nThe story of the medical school begins with a young British surgeon, Dr John Berry White, who arrived in Assam in 1858 at the age of 24. During his 24-year tenure in upper Assam, White rose from being an assistant surgeon to being the civil surgeon of Lakhimpur district. His legacy took shape through an extraordinary act of generosity. Upon retirement in 1882, he donated his entire life savings of Rs 50,000 (estimated to be worth Rs 10 million today) to establish a medical school in Dibrugarh.\\nFour years after White died in London, the institution, established in 1900, became the cornerstone of medical education in the northeast. Its significance grew further when it paved the way for establishing the prestigious Assam Medical College in 1947.\\n\"Dr White\\'s vision was revolutionary for his time. His choice of Dibrugarh as the location, citing it as a ‘centre place\\' in his will, showed remarkable foresight about the region\\'s future importance in the healthcare sector. The current state of the building is an insult to Dr White\\'s memory and his contributions to our region,\" said Dr Bhaskar Gogoi, a medical practitioner from Dibrugarh.\\nAs the structure continues to deteriorate, the people of Dibrugarh hope that renewed attention to this delayed project might finally spur authorities into action, preserving a crucial chapter in northeast\\'s medical history for future generations.\\n\"Dr White\\'s contribution to Assam\\'s medical education is unparalleled. It\\'s our duty to ensure that his legacy is preserved for future generations. We urge the authorities to prioritise this project and bring it to completion without further delay,\" Dibrugarh resident Minakshi Barooah said.\\nStay updated with breaking \\nnews\\n, \\nbank holidays\\n and upcoming\\n public holidays in march\\n.',\n",

She is the first woman officer to lead military health services. In an interview with TOI, she spoke about the indigenous solution to unique health challenges of high altitude, specific focused programmes for Indian Air Force fighter pilots and submariners of the Indian Navy, and key projects that they plan to complete in the near future.\\nWhat is your roadmap for improving combat medical services for the forces?\\nWe already achieved desirable efficiency, coordination, and interoperability among the tri-service elements of the AFMS in delivering seamless combat medical services.\\nChampions Trophy 2025\\nIND vs PAK Live: India target semis spot, Pakistan desperate for survival\\n'Wrong anthem, 'missing' Indian flag ...': CT marred by off-field blunders\\nHow to Watch IND vs PAK Champions Trophy Match in US, India and Dubai\\nTraining and augmentation of infrastructure and resources for the same at various echelons is an ongoing process. Impetus is being given to various research projects to enhance patient care and safety in combat medical support.\\nWhich key infrastructure projects will you initiate or complete in the coming years?\\nThe AFMS recently released a vision document aligned with 'Viksit Bharat @ 2047'. We aim to modernise and expand the infrastructure of military hospitals and field medical units. Various upcoming projects include upgrading field hospitals with modular facilities for enhanced mobility. The 'Yodha Rakshak' programme is a grassroots reform aimed at training all combatants in life-saving skills to empower them to perform self and buddy care during conflict. An Institute of Military Medicine at Lucknow as a Centre of Excellence for combat medical care is on the anvil. A study of patterns of injuries in various conflicts around the world is being envisaged. It will help us prepare for providing medical care in the future. Moreover, developing indigenous solutions to the unique health challenges of high altitude and establishing the High-Altitude Medical Research Institute at Leh would be our priority area.\\nOn health concerns faced by the IAF's fighter pilots and naval personnel serving in submarines\\nWe implemented targeted programmes for these specialised groups. Fighter pilots undergo regular health screenings, with a specific focus on spatial disorientation, G-force tolerance, and stress management. For submariners, we focus on decompression sickness, psychological well-being, and auditory health along with many other aspects, given the unique challenges of prolonged underwater deployment.\\nConsidering the vast deployment of the Indian Army troops across the country, what challenges does AFMS face in providing quality healthcare to them?\\nWe successfully overcame logistical and environmental challenges time and again. Our operational readiness and capabilities to deploy healthcare resources at short notice have been practically demonstrated nationally and internationally. Be it the operationalisation of COVID-19 hospitals in 2020 at various cities in the country or providing relief during the Turkey Earthquake in 2023 or routine healthcare delivery and casualty evacuation from forward field areas such as Siachen Glacier are among crucial successful efforts in the recent past. We are constantly evolving and collaborating to keep pace with technological advancements in healthcare delivery in sync with organisational requirements.\\nWhat are plans to tackle the shortage of doctors in the armed forces?\\nThe requirement of manpower is assessed periodically, and the organisation’s mandate is to induct the best human resources to serve our clientele and fulfil various operational needs. AFMC, one of the premier medical colleges in the country, trains medical graduates for serving the armed forces. In addition, we regularly conduct interviews of medical graduates and specialists from other medical colleges for selection in the AFMS. Regular efforts are underway to attract the best talent in the services. Outreach programmes are being organised at various medical institutions to sensitise medical students about the career opportunities being offered by the AFMS. AFMC has an intake of 150 students for MBBS. As of now, there is no plan to increase it. We recruit around 250-450 Medical Officers (MOs) every year and have taken adequate steps to cover the shortage.\\nHow do you see AFMC's role in the near future?\\nAFMC will continue to be the cornerstone of AFMS by producing world-class medical professionals. We envision it evolving into a global centre for medical research and innovation, emphasising collaborations with international institutions and fostering an environment of academic excellence.\\nWhat new research areas have been identified?\\nMy predecessors already facilitated MoUs with premier institutes such as ICMR, IITs, AIIMS, New Delhi, and other institutes. We encourage collaborative projects and short-term and long-term training, including PhDs by our officers from premier training institutes. Innovations through iDEX and TDAC, collaboration with DRDO in Marine Medicine, upgradation of the Institute of Naval Medicine at INHS Asvini for underwater medicine, and the 'Samudrayaan' project with the National Institute of Ocean Technology are some other areas we are working on. Healthcare research is being undertaken by experts at the Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Bangalore, and the Institute of Naval Medicine, INHS Asvini, Mumbai, as well as providing diagnostic and curative services of the highest standards to dependent clientele.\\nBeing the first woman as the head of the AFMS, tell us about your illustrious journey.\\nIt was an inspiring journey to become the first woman to lead the organisation (AFMS). It was a privilege to serve in all three services. From being the only lady in the armed forces in Kashmir Valley when I served at Kupwara (1998-1999), to medical units at Port Blair and Kochi, at Naval Science and Technological Laboratory, Vizag, and at the Centres of Excellence such as Army Hospital Research & Referral, New Delhi, and Command Hospital at Pune, the experiences garnered deepened my commitment to our soldiers and their well-being. It was challenging to serve as the Command Medical Officer of the Southern and Western Naval Command during COVID-19. I was fortunate to command AFMC, my alma mater, and then served as Director General of Medical Services of the Navy and Air Force. In 39 years of service, I faced many challenges and always remained motivated to serve to the best of my abilities. I undertook a revision of standards of patient safety and quality in AFMS and continued fostering preventive and promotive health, which the armed forces stand for.\\nStay updated with breaking \\nnews\\n, \\nbank holidays\\n and upcoming\\n public holidays in march\\n.\",\n",

As per the People, she said, \"I had asked my boyfriend to give our dog his medication while I was out, but when I came home, he told me he had medicated both dogs.”\\n“I knew that was impossible because we were out of Nellie\\'s UTI medication,” she recalled, realizing in horror that Nellie had ingested her Ambien instead. The confusion was understandable. Beckey had multiple pill bottles from different veterinary clinics—some were brown, while others were blue. Unfortunately, her Ambien prescription also came in a brown bottle, leading her boyfriend to assume it was Nellie’s medication. \\n\"He thought he was giving her the right pill because it was next to our other dog’s medication,\" she explained. Realizing the mistake, Beckey immediately called her veterinarian, who instructed her to contact the Pet Poison Helpline. She then rushed Nellie to an urgent care veterinary clinic in Omaha, Nebraska.\\nAt the clinic, the vets worked closely with poison specialists, as many veterinarians aren’t trained specifically in toxicology. Nellie was given treatment to induce vomiting, administered activated charcoal to absorb the toxins, and placed on IV fluids for overnight monitoring. \\n\"Nellie’s doing great now, but it was a scary and expensive process,\" Beckey shared, revealing that the treatment cost around $1,200, even with pet insurance. Luckily, Nellie fully recovered, but the incident serves as a powerful reminder for all pet owners. A small mistake can lead to a life-threatening situation, making proper medication storage and handling essential to \\nkeeping pets safe\\n.\\nTo prevent accidents like Nellie\\'s, Dr. Renee Schmid, a senior veterinary toxicologist, emphasizes the importance of keeping pet medications separate from human medications. She also advises pet owners with multiple animals to store each pet\\'s medication separately, as mixing up bottles can be easy and potentially dangerous, leading to serious health consequences if the wrong medication is given.',\n",

Upon their return, they became eligible to practise medicine in India by passing the \\nForeign Medical Graduate Examination\\n (FMGE) conducted by NBEMS in Dec 2023. Earlier this year, NBEHMS passed orders recalling the pass certificates of these three petitioners on the grounds that their medical course in Georgia was six years long, and their internship began during the 6th semester and spread across the 12th semester at their LLC Caucasus International University.\\nHowever, the sixth-year syllabus mentions new subjects being taught by the university. Since they obtained provisional certificates after completing five years, the provisional certificates were misleading to seek eligibility for the exam and were issued after the cut-off date of the respective session.\\nThe NBEMS claimed that they submitted false documentation to prove possession of the primary medical qualification without actually completing the course towards the minimum eligibility for the FMGE. Subsequently, the Gujarat Medical Council (GMC) on Feb 13 revoked the provisional registration granted to the three to practise medicine with immediate effect, rendering them ineligible for internship and further medical registration.\\n\"You are prohibited from continuing internship or practising medicine under the revoked registration, and any attempt to do so shall be considered unlawful and subject to legal action,\" the GMC\\'s order reads.

OIL signed a memorandum of understanding with the \\nIndian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage\\n (INTACH) to preserve, restore and convert the historic structure into a museum. However, the project, which was originally scheduled for completion in April 2019, remains unfinished in Feb 2025.\\nDibrugarh residents expressed their disappointment over the prolonged delay in completing the project.\\n\"It\\'s heartbreaking to see such a historically significant structure in such a state of neglect. The authorities have failed to honour Dr White\\'s legacy. We were promised a museum that would celebrate our heritage, but seven years later, we are still waiting,\" said Rupam Baruah, a local.\\nThe story of the medical school begins with a young British surgeon, Dr John Berry White, who arrived in Assam in 1858 at the age of 24. During his 24-year tenure in upper Assam, White rose from being an assistant surgeon to being the civil surgeon of Lakhimpur district. His legacy took shape through an extraordinary act of generosity. Upon retirement in 1882, he donated his entire life savings of Rs 50,000 (estimated to be worth Rs 10 million today) to establish a medical school in Dibrugarh.\\nFour years after White died in London, the institution, established in 1900, became the cornerstone of medical education in the northeast. Its significance grew further when it paved the way for establishing the prestigious Assam Medical College in 1947.\\n\"Dr White\\'s vision was revolutionary for his time. His choice of Dibrugarh as the location, citing it as a ‘centre place\\' in his will, showed remarkable foresight about the region\\'s future importance in the healthcare sector. The current state of the building is an insult to Dr White\\'s memory and his contributions to our region,\" said Dr Bhaskar Gogoi, a medical practitioner from Dibrugarh.\\nAs the structure continues to deteriorate, the people of Dibrugarh hope that renewed attention to this delayed project might finally spur authorities into action, preserving a crucial chapter in northeast\\'s medical history for future generations.\\n\"Dr White\\'s contribution to Assam\\'s medical education is unparalleled. It\\'s our duty to ensure that his legacy is preserved for future generations. We urge the authorities to prioritise this project and bring it to completion without further delay,\" Dibrugarh resident Minakshi Barooah said.\\nStay updated with breaking \\nnews\\n, \\nbank holidays\\n and upcoming\\n public holidays in march\\n.',\n",
